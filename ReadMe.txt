This project uses the Real-Time Messaging Protocol (RTMP) to handle audio and video streaming because it has broad support.
First we will install the updates in operating system.
then install Nginx web server.
then get the RTMP module so Nginx can handle the media stream.
then adjust the web server's configuration so it can accept and deliver our media stream.

then set up the BSD Server.
Update ports.
create a webroot directory from where Nginx will serve its content.
Load the streaming modules.
change the webroot location to match the one we created earlier.
finally add the RTMP settings so Nginx will know how to handle our media streams.
Now set up streaming software.
